# Polyclinic-site

Polyclinic Site is a project aimed at providing a streamlined and efficient way to manage **medical consultations online**. With a focus on user experience and accessibility, the site offers an intuitive and easy-to-use interface for patients to book and manage appointments, with a convenient **integration with WhatsApp** for communication and follow-up.

The site is built using React and styled with Tailwindcss, ensuring fast and responsive performance across all devices. A thorough design process was undertaken using Figma, resulting in a sleek and modern look that is both visually appealing and functional.

To facilitate collaboration between the development team, consisting of Lautaro Toledo and Brenda Santos, a Kanban Flow system was implemented.
